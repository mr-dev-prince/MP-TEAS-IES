          gadgets, robots, ChatGPT and others with unbelievable outcomes.
          However, at the same time the universal threats in Expert Applications
          need to be focused and analysed while developing satisfactory
          solutions for the same. This will help the society to prevent itself
          from ill effects of the technological developments.
