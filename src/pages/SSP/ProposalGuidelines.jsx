          specific new challenges, applications and experiences, to establish
          business or research relations, and to find global partners for future
          collaboration on emerging issues.
        </p>
        <p>
          The Expert Application concept of the conference will focus on current
          advances in the research and use of Engineering with particular focus
          on the role in maintaining academic level while sharing novel research

        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>MP-TEAS 2024</strong>, first of all, it is an abbreviation of
          the full name of the Conference i.e. "
          <strong>
            Modern Practices and Trends in Expert Applications & Security
          </strong>
          ". Another meaning breaks it into <strong>MP and TEAS</strong>,
          wherein <strong>MP</strong> represents Major Problems such as the
          Hurdles, Challenges, Issues, and Limitations being faced by the
          Researchers in the pursuance of their Research Practices &
          Implementation of Innovations, and <strong>TEAS</strong> are the
          Knowledge Dissemination and Exchange of Ideas to solve the Major
          Problems. Through MP-TEAS 2024, all the concerned people will be
          provided a genuine platform of all possible solutions, and
          opportunities to find ways to come out of their research problems and
          limitations.
        </p>
        <p>
          Another idea to keep this name MP-TEAS is that this conference is
          being organized in <strong>IES University, Bhopal</strong> which is
          situated in the state <strong>Madhya Pradesh (MP)</strong> in India,
          and the solutions to the Major Problems as stated above will be
          discussed during the various{" "}
          <strong>TEA Sessions and TEA Breaks</strong> (TEAS) wherein the
          participants find many opportunities to collect Knowledge, Explore
          more, establish strong Networking, and platform for Sharing each
          otherâ€™s ideas.
        </p>
        <p>
          In true sense, <strong>MP-TEAS 2024</strong> provides an International
          Platform in the city of Bhopal in Madhya Pradesh (MP) through the TEAS
          of Great Knowledge, Innovations, and Networking Opportunities.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>MP-TEAS 2024</strong> features invited keynote speeches as
          well as peer-reviewed paper presentations. The conference is

          discussant to attend. The Expert Application concept of the conference
          will focus on current advances in the research and use of Engineering
          with particular focus on the role in maintaining academic level while
          sharing novel research and cutting-edge developments in the fields of
          Computer and Intelligent System Security using cryptographic
          algorithms and other security schemes for system as well as cloud.
