          We are seeking for unique entries that have never been published and
          aren't currently being considered by any other journals or
          conferences. The conference will provide an international platform to
          the researchers, academicians, industry representatives, government
          officials, students and other stakeholders in the field to explore the
          opportunities, to disseminate and acquire beneficial knowledge from
          the various issues deliberated in the paper presented on different
          themes in the conference.

          The selected papers will be published in different proceedings and
          journals indexed by SCI, Scopus, Web of Science, Google Scholar and
          others that would give an international exposure to the research
          carried out and opportunities to get the work viewed and cited by
          researchers throughout the world.

          It would also be beneficial in terms of Networking, since the
          stakeholders from 20+ countries are expected to arrive and exchange
          their thoughts, ideas, solutions on research carried out in the
          relevant areas. This would facilitate them to create new contacts to
          further uplift and fulfil any future research or collaborative
          requirements through better networking.
